<p class = 'entry-content'> This site has a backend built from scratch powered by Python, Postgres and served with Flask. The Front-End is made with custom bootstrap and a smattering of vanilla JavaScript. 
    It includes a small CMS I built to more easily manage my blog posts and new project additions.
