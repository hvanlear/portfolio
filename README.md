# Personal Portfolio and Blog

This is the source code to my personal portfolio and blog. It includes a small CMS I built to more easily manage my blog posts and new project additions. In terms of styling, minimalism and speed were fore front in my considerations. It is a constant work in progress.

## Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - Backend Framework, Templating
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database used for user managment, blog post and project storage
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Highly customized bootstrap theme for the frontend, primarily for responsiveness

## Authors
